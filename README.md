Adventures of Old
=================

Adventures of Old is an online multiplayer co-op game developed using the Unity Engine. Bringing a new approach to old-school role playing games, AoO was made by a team of 7 within a 6-month development period.

The key gameplay features:

- **Evolving Chaos**: The Evolving Chaos system makes use of a game component known as the Chaos Counter.  As the game progresses, enemies will become stronger with increased power, health, and abilities.  Players will have to balance their time wisely or they may risk facing impossibly strong monsters.

- **Power Contests**: The Power Contest system allows for players to face off against monsters in engaging combat, without the need for a game master to pilot them.  By comparing a player’s power and dice rolls against a monster’s power, either the player or the monster will strike the other depending on the outcome.
